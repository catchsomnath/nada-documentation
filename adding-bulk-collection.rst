====================================
Bulk Data Access by Collections
====================================

The data access collections allow users to request access to multiple studies by filling in a single request form instead of submitting a new request for each study in the catalog.

To get started, first login as 'Administrator' and then from the admin menu navigate to `Studies` > `Bulk Access Collection`.
